## Analysis of Results By Scenario
This file contains the analysis of the results obtained after the evaluation step by scenario.

## Experimental Setup and Results

Experiments were conducted to evaluate the system's performance on the following task:

- [Task 1: ensure exhaustive coverage of the system's defined technical scenarios]
- [Task 2: demonstrate the cross-domain generalizability of our approach through its application to heterogeneous datasets]
- [Task 3: empirically assess the pertinence of the generated reduction suggestions, both in terms of alignment with technical compatibility and preservation of task-specific performance]

### 1. Healthcare \& Medical Diagnostics 

Dataset: [Heart Attack Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/juledz/heart-attack-prediction)

Priority Order: Reduced size → Interpretability → Performance → Computational cost
- In medical contexts, datasets often involve high-dimensional patient data. Reduced size is prioritized to improve model robustness and mitigate overfitting.
- Interpretability is crucial because clinicians must understand and trust model decisions, especially in high-stakes scenarios.
- While performance is important, it’s acceptable to slightly compromise accuracy for transparency.
- Computational cost is less critical due to access to hospital infrastructure or cloud computing.

4. Computational cost - Retained Options:
![Priority 4](.github/assests/images/1.4.Priority.png)

#### Result Analysis

As we can observe in these tables, the two options displayed the same results. That is explained by the fact that when executiong option two, T-SVD failed after FAMD. This can be due to:
 - insufficient domain related configuration
 - FAMD can output NaNs or infinite values, if normalization fails due to 0 variance
 - Missing values, from categories with low variance

##### If T-SVD failed to perform, why do we still have it as an option ? 

The retained options  have the same performance profile, even if T-SVD failed. Both solutions were selected from Pareto efficient clusters. 

#### Conclusion 

These results resulted in several conclusions:

1. The recommendations retained by our solution correspond to the technical profile and the analytical task of the user.
2. We were not able to conclude on the level of compatibility with the ranked priorities of the user.
3. The second helped us identify several limits of our solution:

   3.1. Missiong domain-knowledge

   3.2. Insufficient implementations

   3.3. Insufficient personalization of the Reduction Techniques in an objective of better compqtibility with the compatible Reduction Techniques (the permutations couples)

### 2. Tourism \& Hospitality Management 

Dataset: [Hotel Booking](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessemostipak/hotel-booking-demand)

Priority Order: Computational cost → Performance → Reduced size → Interpretability
- In hospitality systems (e.g., booking platforms), fast and cost-efficient decisions are essential for handling large volumes of user requests in real-time.
- Performance matters for ensuring booking accuracy and user satisfaction.
- Reduced size is secondary, useful for reducing latency.
- Interpretability is less crucial as decisions affect revenue but not human health or safety.

### 3. Sociodemographic Studies \& Public Policy 

Dataset: [Housing](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/camnugent/california-housing-prices)

Priority Order: Performance → Computational cost → Reduced size → Interpretability 
- In policy-making, accurate prediction or classification of social phenomena is central for resource allocation and planning.
- Computational cost is considered because these studies often use large government datasets.
- Reduced size is valued to ensure feasibility on standard infrastructure.
- Interpretability is less critical as decisions are aggregated and not made at the individual level.

### 4. Finance \& Risk Management 

[Company Bankruptcy Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/company-bankruptcy-prediction)

Priority Order: Performance → Computational cost → Reduced size → Interpretability 
- Financial systems require high-performing models for forecasting, fraud detection, and risk assessment.
- Computational efficiency is vital due to the volume and velocity of financial data.
- Reduced size improves real-time applicability.
- While interpretability is helpful (e.g., for regulatory compliance), it often takes a back seat to predictive accuracy in trading and risk scenarios.

#### Priority Compatibility

We have obtained only one recommendation that is compatible with the statistical properties of the dataset. This means that only one reduction strategy has satisfied the technical constraints and has an optimal distribution of the values of the criteria for priorization.
In this context, it is irrelevant to search for priority compatibility.
